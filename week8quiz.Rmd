Add Vectors in For Loop
This difers from vector addition because the vector c is being incremented element by element which is slower.

```{r}
a <- c(1, 3, 5, 7)
b <- c(1, 2, 4, 8)
c = NULL
for (i in 1:4) 
  {
  c[i] <- a[i]+b[i]
  }

print(c)
```

While Loop

```{r}
d <- c("heads","heads","tails","tails")
e <- 1
f <- 0

while (d[e] == "heads") {
  e <- e + 1
  f <- f + 1
    }

print(f)


e <- 1
f <- 0

while (d[e] == "tails") {
  e <- e + 1
  f <- f + 1
    }

print(f)
```

For Loop to Add Odd Numbers

```{r}
g <- 0
for (i in 1:100)
  ifelse (i %% 2 == 1, g <- g+ 1, g <- g)
print(g)

h <- NULL
h <- ifelse (1:100 %% 2 == 1, 1, 0)
i <- sum(h)
print(i)

```
